            <li>Terraria</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>My comment on those games:</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Valheim</dt>
            <dd>It's a survival viking. game that's impossible to not be mad about unless you haven't played enough.</dd>
            <dt>Monster Hunter World</dt>
            <dd>Like the name, the game is about hunting monsters. You as a hunter given a mission to conquer the new world and research those monster
                so that we could know the ecology of the new world.
            </dd>
            <dt>Monster Hunter Rise</dt>
            <dd>It's similar to Monster Hunter World but instead of researching the monsters and it's ecosystem, it focused on the battle 
                between you and the monster.</dd>
            <dt>Terraria</dt>
            <dd>Terraria is a sandbox pixel survival game with the objective of defeating bosses or just build your house.
                The gameplay is like a bullet hell game, a game where you dodge the projectiles while fighting an enemy.
